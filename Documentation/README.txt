You can regenerate an Xcode docset for SOLogger by running "sh appledoc.sh" from a shell.

The appledoc tool must be installed on your system somewhere, including its templates.
You can get it from GitHub at <https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/>.

The appledoc.sh script expects appledoc to be installed in its default location, /usr/local/bin/appledoc.

May the force be with you.
